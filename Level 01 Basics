# Phase 1: Variables & Data Types 🧠

In this section, I am learning how Python stores information in the computer's memory.

### 📝 Key Takeaways:
1. **Dynamic Typing:** Python automatically detects if a variable is a number, text, or logic.
2. **Variable Naming:** I am using `snake_case` (e.g., `user_name`) which is the professional standard for Python.
3. **Data Types:**
   - "int": Whole numbers (e.g., Number of stocks).
   - "float": Decimals (e.g., Stock price).
   - "str": Text (e.g., Company name).
   - "bool": Logic (e.g., Is market open?).

### 💡Concept: Memory Allocation
When I create a variable, the computer allocates a small "bucket" in RAM to hold that specific value.


# --- LESSON 1: THE BASICS ---

# 1. Defining Variables (Storing data in memory)
index_name = "NIFTY 50"       # String (str)
current_value = 22123.45      # Float (float)
companies_count = 50          # Integer (int)
is_market_bullish = True      # Boolean (bool)

# 2. Outputting Data (Using f-strings for clean display)
print(f"Index: {index_name}")
print(f"Current Value: {current_value}")
print(f"Number of Companies: {companies_count}")

# 3. Dynamic Changes
# Let's simulate the market moving up by 10 points
new_value = current_value + 10.50
print(f"Updated {index_name} Value: {new_value}")

# 4. Checking Data Types (The 'type' function)
# As a CS student, it's vital to know what type you are working with
print(f"Data type of index_name: {type(index_name)}")
print(f"Data type of current_value: {type(current_value)}")
